> To start the challenge using IRC, you must send a private message to bot
> Candy : !ep1. The bot replies with a message in private with a string
> like this:
>
> ```
> <number1>/<number2>
> ```
>
> - You must calculate the square root of the number nÂ°1 and multiply the
>   result by the number nÂ°2.
> - Then you need to round to two decimals.
> - You have 2 seconds to send the correct answer from the time the bot
>   gets the message !ep1
> - If the bot does not respond, then you have been banned.
>   Just wait a few minutes.
> - The answer must be sent as :
>
> ```
> !ep1 -rep <answer>.
> ```
>
> **Example**
>
> ```
