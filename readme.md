# Root Me CTF Solutions

This repository houses my personal solutions to
[Root Me's programming challenges][challenges].

It is strongly encouraged that you do not view my solutions unless you've
already solved the relevant problems yourself.


## Background

Each challenge consists of some (typically non-static) dataset that must be
processed according to the problem statement and submitted back to the specified
URI via a `GET` or `POST` request. Assuming a correct and timely submission,
points for the specified challenge are automatically credited to your account.

Most challenges have a dataset/solution TTL of a few seconds, so performance
isn't that important.
